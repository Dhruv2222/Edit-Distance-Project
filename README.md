Implementing the Edit Distance for Word Autocompletion and Autocorrection

## Edit Distance:

The Edit distance is a text similarity measure that compares two words and returns a numeric value representing the distance between them. The distance reflects the total number of single-character edits required to transform one word into another. The more similar the two words are the less distance between them, and vice versa. One common use for this distance is in the autocompletion or autocorrection features of text processors or chat applications.

## Dictionary Search for Word Autocompletion and Autocorrection

One application of the Edit distance is to help the writer write faster by automatically correcting typos or completing words. In this topic we are experimenting with a small version of the English dictionary (which contains 3,000 common words) to complete this task. The dictionary is available for download at this link.

## The sections covered are as follows:

Creating the distances matrix
Initializing the distances matrix
Calculating distances between all prefixes
Printing the distances matrix.
Dictionary search for autocompletion/autocorrection
